    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Med Saathi — Your Family's Health Companion<br>Last updated: March 1, 2026</p>

    <p>Digik Labs ("we", "our", or "us") built Med Saathi as a health management application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>a) Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you sign up, we collect your name and email address through Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In, or email/password registration. Authentication is handled securely via Supabase.</p>

    <h3>b) Health & Medical Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Medication details (names, dosages, schedules, adherence logs)</li>
        <li>Vitals data (blood pressure, blood sugar, and other health metrics you enter)</li>
        <li>Medical reports you upload (PDF, JPG, PNG files)</li>
        <li>ABHA health ID and linked health records (if you choose to integrate)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>c) Family Data</h3>
    <p>If you create or join a family group, we store family member profiles and share health data between authorized family members as configured by you.</p>

    <h3>d) Payment Information</h3>
    <p>Subscription payments are processed through Razorpay. We do not store your credit/debit card details. Payment processing is handled entirely by Razorpay under their own privacy policy.</p>

    <h3>e) Device Permissions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera & Storage:</strong> Used to capture or select medical reports for upload</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used for medication reminders and health alerts via Firebase Cloud Messaging</li>
        <li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Used for local app lock (fingerprint/face). Biometric data never leaves your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide medication tracking, reminders, and adherence monitoring</li>
        <li>To store and organize your medical reports</li>
        <li>To enable family health management and data sharing between authorized members</li>
        <li>To send medication reminders and health alert notifications</li>
        <li>To process subscription payments</li>
        <li>To improve and maintain the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely on Supabase (cloud-hosted PostgreSQL). Uploaded files (medical reports, images) are stored in Supabase Storage with row-level security policies ensuring only authorized users can access their data.</p>
    <p>We use industry-standard encryption for data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Supabase (data hosting), Firebase (notifications), Razorpay (payments) — these providers process data on our behalf under their respective privacy policies</li>
        <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> If required by law or to protect our rights</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Advertising & Analytics</h2>
    <p>Med Saathi does <strong>not</strong> contain any advertisements. We do not use third-party analytics or tracking SDKs.</p>
